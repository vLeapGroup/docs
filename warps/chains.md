# Supported Blockchains

Warp Protocol supports multiple blockchain networks, enabling flexible and powerful cross-chain interactions. Below are the currently supported blockchains and their specific features.

## MultiversX

MultiversX is a high-performance blockchain network supported by Warp Protocol. Developers can execute actions directly on the MultiversX main chain or leverage its advanced and customizable sub-networks called LightSpeed Chains.

### LightSpeed Chains

LightSpeed Chains, formerly Sovereign Chains, are a special class of chains within the MultiversX ecosystem. They enable developers to create custom blockchains that connect seamlessly to the MultiversX main network, offering more flexibility.

Warps are inscribed and registered on the main network and can be executed on whitelisted LightSpeed Chains if specified in the action. Whitelisted chains and their configurations are managed in the [Registry](./registry.md).

---

The `chain` parameter allows developers to target a specific LightSpeed Chain for individual Warp actions of type `transfer`, `contract`, or `query`. If omitted, the action defaults to the MultiversX main chain.

```js
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "contract",
      "chain": "example-lightspeed-chain",
      "func": "execute",
    },
    {
      "type": "query",
      "chain": "another-lightspeed-chain",
      "func": "getBalance",
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the Warp executes a contract action on `example-lightspeed-chain` and a query action on `another-lightspeed-chain`. This flexibility allows a single Warp to interact with multiple LightSpeed Chains or the main network within the same Blueprint.

## SUI

SUI is also supported by Warp Protocol, allowing developers to interact with the SUI blockchain using the same flexible Warp actions.

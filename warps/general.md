# MultiversX Warps: Share Transactions via Links

Warps are on-chain data structures that provide all necessary information to construct complex UIs for generating transactions on the MultiversX blockchain. By sending a Warp to a friend or customer, they can easily access a generated UI to execute the intended transaction, such as swaps, delegating eGold, or other smart contract interactions.

Warps can be shared through any medium capable of encoding or displaying URLs, including web platforms, QR codes, NFC tags, etc.
